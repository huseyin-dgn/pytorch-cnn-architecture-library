== data ==
- num_images, num_labels
- class_counts
- train/val leakage check (hash/pHash)
- resolution distribution (H,W)
- brightness/contrast histogram
- blur score (variance of Laplacian)
- noise proxy (high-frequency energy)

== detection_specific ==
- bbox area distribution
- bbox width/height distribution
- small/medium/large ratio
- aspect ratio distribution of boxes
- crowd/overlap stats (IoU among boxes)

== pipeline ==
- resize/letterbox correctness (bbox transform test)
- augmentation sanity (bbox stays valid?)
- normalization correctness (mean/std ranges)

== compute ==
- expected batch size
- BN vs GN decision
- fps/latency target
